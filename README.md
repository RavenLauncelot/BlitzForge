This is my final year project which is a Tank RTS game. By the end of the project I'm expecting to have:
fully working controllable units with support for 
- movement 
- forced attacks
- automatic attacks 
AI enemies or multiplayer support 
Destructible buildings (potentially)
in game UI
- highlights selected units paths 
- currenttly selected unit targets 
- currently selected units
- shows health of units
